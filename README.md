TwoThreeFive

Description: TwoThreeFive is a remake of an Ancient Indian card game for a COMP 170 course. The game can be played against a preprogrammed bot who is coded to correctly follow the rules, or have the bot play against itself and you can see the outcome. 

What I learned: 
-	Writing this program allowed me to learn typical methods OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) which includes how to effectively use classes to organize a program.
-	This project also allowed me to practice going from verbal/written rules, to pseudocode, to code that works. This occurred thanks to having to code the rules of the game so that the bot played correctly.
